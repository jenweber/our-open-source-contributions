# Our Open Source Contributions

This is a practice repository for anyone who wants to try out the open source
collaboration workflow before jumping into a "real" open source project. Feel free
to make some commits and a PR! For example, you could add to our list of
goals at the bottom of this page, right here in this README. Any files
are welcome to be edited :)

Past workshop info and slides are available in [archive/workshop-history.md](archive/workshop-history.md)
